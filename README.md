# CSharpSECSTools

**CSharpSECSTools** is a project for those that are working primarily in th realm of shop floor automation in the semiconductor industry. 
If you do not work in that industry or you are not familiar with the [SEMI Standards](www.semi.org/en/standards) 
**E4**, **E5**, **E30**, **E37**, el al, this project is probably not for you. 

This project provides some tools for problem identification and monitoring as well as API libraries that will help 
in writing software for equipment interfaces and / or equipment simulators.

## Get the code
Use the <code>git clone</code> command to get the code. 

<code>git clone https://github.com/dkaip/CSharpSECSTools CSharpSECSTools</code> 

This will create a <code>CSharpSECSTools</code> directory in your current directory

## Building
Currently, this project may be built using MonoDevelop 7.3.3.  It has been built 
and unit tests run using earlier versions as well.

## Documentation
I am currently trying to identify the &quot;proper&quot; documentation tool to use 
(i.e. the equivalent of javadoc) so the API documentation may be provided.
