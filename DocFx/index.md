# **CSharpSECSTools**
This project provides some APIs and Utility programs that may be useful for those working in the problem domain of Semiconductor Manufacturing.  More specifically, the automation thereof using computers to control the manufacturing process potentially including integration with Automated Material Handling Systems(AMHS).  As you might infer these APIs and Utilities are written in the C# programming language and thus appropriate for those working in those software development environments.

If you are not familiar with the [Semi&reg; Standards](https://www.semi.org/en/standards) like **E4**, **E5**, **E30**, **E37**, et al, this project is probably not for you.
