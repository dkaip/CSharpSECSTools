      <section><p>This class represents/implements a <code>SECSItem</code> with the SECS data type of <code>A</code>
(<code>ASCII</code>),
which is a &quot;string&quot; of<code>ASCII</code> characters.From the C# side this data
type is handled as a C# <code>string</code>. Be careful to only use appropriate character sets
(System.Text.Encoding.ASCII) or undesirable behavior may be manifested.</p>

in an array form. In this case it is an array of zero or more 8-bit boolean values.
From the C# side this data type is handled as a C# <code>bool []</code>.</p>
<p>In &quot;wire/transmission&quot; format all SECS items, with the exception of those
with an item format code of <code>L</code>(List), are sent in an array form.For instance
if an item is received which has an item format code of I4 (32-bit signed integer)
and has a length of 8 you know that is it an array containing 2 4-byte signed integers.
If it has a length of 0 you know it is an array with zero 4-byte signed integers.
Likewise, If an item is received which has an item format code of U2 (16-bit unsigned integer)
and has a length of 6 you know that is it an array containing 3 2-byte unsigned integers.</p>
<p>In practice, when only one item is received in the array (in the I4 case mentioned previously
if the length was 4 instead of 8) it is handled and processed in a non array form.  Hence
<code>I4SECSItem</code> * vs <code>I4ArraySECSItem</code>, <code>U2SECSItem</code> vs <code>U2ArraySECSItem</code>, etc.</p>
